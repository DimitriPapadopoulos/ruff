/// ## What it does
/// Checks for a shebang directive in a file that is not executable.
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// In Python, a shebang (also known as a hashbang) is the first line of a
/// script, which specifies the interpreter that should be used to run the
/// script.
///
/// The presence of a shebang suggests that a file is intended to be
/// executable. If a file contains a shebang but is not executable, then the
/// shebang is misleading, or the file is missing the executable bit.
///
/// If the file is meant to be executable, add a shebang; otherwise, remove the
/// executable bit from the file.
///
/// _This rule is only available on Unix-like systems._
